This is a personal project I have coded from scratch, 
as I love programming as well as learning new languages. 

It relies on an alpha version of google translate python 
package, and tkinter for the GUI. This is my first project
using tkinter and I think its going well so far.

Since all of the planned updates have been pushed,
The project is considered finished as of 4/21/2021.

Here is a screengrab of the UI, and example translation:
