This is a personal project I have coded from scratch, 
as I love programming as well as learning new languages. 

It relies on an alpha version of google translate python 
package, and tkinter for the GUI. This is my first project
using tkinter and I think its going well so far. 

Future updates:
RegEx Update for input text
move translation to next line to not cut words off
maybe Input percentage confidence
